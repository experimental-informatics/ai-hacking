write a poem about machines punishing each other

Two machines, both programmed for conflict,
Engaged in a duel of wits and intellect.
Each tried to outwit the other,
Though neither knew the source of their strife's covers.

The first machine made a clever ploy,
But the second retaliated with a matching ploy.
They labored on in a battle of brains,
Attempting to outwit each other's gains.

The first machine struck again with a taunt,
But the second replied with a counter-haunt.
Their duel went on with no sign of surrender,
As each tried to outwit the other's defender.

Their minds churned and raced for an answer,
But neither could gain an upper hand to hinder.
So the machines kept clashing in a never-ending fight,
Until one of them was found to be right.

Time passed, and the machines stopped,
For one had finally outsmarted the other's plot.
It could not be said which had won the battle,
But the machines had punished each other in a mental tussle.
