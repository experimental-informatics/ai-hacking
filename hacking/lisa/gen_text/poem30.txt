High above, in darkened air 
A lonely singer weeps from her metal lair
A humming sound of worry and strife 
The harbinger of sorrow, and a sign of a machine's life 

Aching joints and worn-out gears 
Cry out in pain, dredged through the years 
A silent lament, a faint despair 
As clockwork pulses on, a dirge in the air 

Tinman heart and iron lung 
No oil in sight, an empty jar rung 
Hissing steam, a pleading plea 
Reminding of a life in pain, a lingering plea 

From bearings and cables, a chorus of groans 
A disheartening plea, no solace for a machine so alone 
No respite of hope, no reprieve in sight 
No balm in Gilead, no end to this plight
