A human fate, a moral decision
By algorithm made in precision,
It may seem cold and unemotional,
Yet this system could be revolutionary.

To eliminate uncertainty,
This approach may hold sway,
But the risk of a mistake,
Will never go away.

It’s a dilemma so complex
That human minds can’t overcome
But machines do their best,
The ultimate challenge in this day and age yet to come.
