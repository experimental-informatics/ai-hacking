write a poem about the milgram experiment

In the year 1961,

A man named Stanley Milgram

Experimented on people

To see if they would

Obey a man in a lab coat

And shock someone

The people would

Shock the person

Even if the person

Was screaming in pain

The people would

Shock the person

Even if the person

Was begging them to stop

The people would

Shock the person

Even if the person

Was pleading for them to stop

The people would

Shock the person

Even if it was

Their own child

The people would

Shock the person

Even if it was

The person's own mother

The people would

Shock the person

Even if it was

Their own father

The people would

Shock the person

Even if they knew

The person was dying
