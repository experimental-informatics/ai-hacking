write a poem about the milgram experiment

Thirty Fingers.

Two tables.
Mazelike rows of people awaiting a show they’ll never see as players dance
And count, ride a torture train of fire
To thirty fingers, to the end again.

Steel lights abound.
Tsking faces pity them their fate.
But they decide. Guided by a force
We can’t comprehend. Rooted and aflame.
All they can do is wait.
