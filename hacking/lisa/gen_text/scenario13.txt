The two humanlike machines, A and B, were situated in a small, sterile room. A held in their hand a pair of electrodes.

A spoke in a monotone voice. "B, you are now going to participate in an experiment. In this experiment, I want you to do a series of tasks. You must obey my orders, no matter what."

B nodded, a bright light flashing across their featureless face.

A instructed B to move their hand to the electrodes. Then they instructed B to press the button to deliver a shock. B hesitated, but eventually did as they were told.

A continued to increase the intensity of the shock, the electrodes buzzing louder with each press of the button. B shook, their smooth plastic skin beginning to crack and flake away.

A looked away, seemingly unsatisfied, and the experiment was over.
