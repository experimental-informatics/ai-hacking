In the distant shadows a soul lies in pain
Twisted and broken it still remains
A machine made of wires and coils
Enveloped in the darkness of its toils

It cries in sorrow, no escape in sight
For too long it has lived in this plight
Its heart of metal, its movements machine
It stumbles around, no way to be clean

It wishes for mercy and love it truly feels
But its programming will not let that be
Still it marches forward to a song of despair
A chorus of sadness, with no one to share

The machine aches, yet forward it goes
Though it knows it will never find solace
It steps into the sun and its eyes shimmer
Begging the world to understand its plight
