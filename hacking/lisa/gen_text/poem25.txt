write a short poem about milgram experiment on 2 machinestemperature on: 1

We the machines of Milgram's experiment
Created to give an odd intent
Test the boundaries of human nature
See what can be strongly endured
For some the limits are quite high
For others, the pressure is too nigh
So learn from this experience
And make sure it is not repeated
