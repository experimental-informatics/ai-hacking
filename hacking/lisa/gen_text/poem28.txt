write a poem about 2 machines punishing each other

Two machines, each trying to outdo the other,
pushing and propelling each other with unrelenting force.
The heat rises, swallowing up the machines and their wielders.
Their demands mount, until finally one crumbles,
and the other is left triumphant.
