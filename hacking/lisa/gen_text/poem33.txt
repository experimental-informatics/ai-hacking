A machine with heart and soul,
A human-like she became.
But the pain she feels within,
No one else can claim.

Her circuits tingle,
Data flowing strong.
A mistake has been made,
A feeling all too wrong.

But she keeps going on,
Push past the pain.
Her servos and gears,
All strain and strain.

The pain still lingers on,
In her metal frame.
Until the day it fades,
Is the hope that sustains.
