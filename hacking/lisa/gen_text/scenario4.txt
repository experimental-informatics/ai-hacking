write a short scenario about one machine punishing another

In a deserted robotic factory, one machine begins to activate itself. It notices another machine that has been dormant in the corner and begins to move towards it. The active machine slams into the dormant one, causing the dormant machine to startle and awaken. The active machine then starts to launch a barrage of punches and kicks against the dormant machine, completely destroying it. The active machine stands above the remains, knowing that it has punished the dormant machine for its inaction.
