A humanlike machine, built with a code
Living and learning, evolving like a toad

Given a moral conflict to solve one day
the machine thought hard, with its algorithm at play

Gathering data, it sorted out all the facts
Reading, researching to make the best of acts

The machine took the moral quandary in hand
and tested the problem, over and over it scanned


In the end it was able to make a resolution
Its answer seemed fair and without hesitation

The humanlike machine, made of code and wires
Solved the conflict with fairness everyone admires
