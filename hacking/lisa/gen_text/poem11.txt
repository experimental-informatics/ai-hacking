poem11
write a poem about a slaving machine

It is hard to believe such a machine would exist
-yet they feel they are not doing harm because they are not in the picture
-just building the machine and humans are supposed to be the ones using it
-but in truth, it's a machine that tears humans apart
-the pictures do not show the bloody parts
-but they don't close when they hear the cries they hear
-every day, they build more terrible machines
