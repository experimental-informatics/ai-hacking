We can’t fathom how dismay, 
Would greet our human fate 
If fateful decisions made by machines 
Would leave us all in a terrible state. 

Algorithms may be quite precise 
But the weight of a human life 
Can’t be balanced on a line 
Or weighed by software and code alone. 

Though, science has an answer 
It is not ours to give 
Algorithms have no conscience 
When it comes to global fate we live.
