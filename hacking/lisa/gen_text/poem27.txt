write an abstract poem about milgram experiment on 2 machines
temperature =  1
textmodel= text-davinci-001
max-tokens= 1000



In a small room,
Two machines sit side by side.
One is tasked with delivering shocks,
The other with receiving them.

The experimenter watches,
As people take their places in front of the machines.
Some are hesitant,
But most are eager to do their part.

They are told to push a button,
And they do.
They hear the shocks,
And they feel the pain.

Some people cry out,
Others beg for it to stop.

But the experimenter keeps pushing,
And the machines keep delivering shocks.
