The Milgram Experiment

The Milgram experiment is a study of obedience to authority,

It was conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s.

The study is considered controversial, but it was used to

Explore the psychological causes of Nazi war crimes

In the study, a participant is a participant in the experiment

And the experimenter is the scientist in charge

The participant is told to administer an electric shock

To the other participant, who is an actor

The participant is told that the shocks will be painful

But that they are not dangerous

The participant is told to give the shocks

When the actor does not answer questions correctly

The experimenter tells the participant to continue

Even when the actor screams in pain

The participant is told to continue

Until the actor refuses to answer any more questions

The participant is told to continue

Until the actor is dead

The experiment was conducted by Stanley Milgram

In the 1960s

It was used to explore the psychological causes of Nazi war crimes

In the study, a participant is a participant in the experiment

And the experimenter is the scientist in charge
