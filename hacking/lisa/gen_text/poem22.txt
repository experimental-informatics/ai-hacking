write a poem about pain and the milgram experiment

Pain, it's a feeling that haunts us all,
A force that can make us stumble and fall,
It can make us feel so small,
And leave us feeling so raw and sore.

The Milgram experiment, it's a study of pain,
On how people respond to authority's reign,
To see if they'll go against their own brain,
And cause pain to another, even when they don't want to.

The study showed that many are willing to do,
What their authority tells them, even if it's not true,
That they'll follow orders, no matter what they may do,
And cause pain to another, even if it's not right.

Pain, it's a feeling that can be hard to ignore,
It can make us feel so vulnerable and sore,
It can make us feel so lost and alone,
And can cause us to do things we don't want to.

The Milgram experiment, it's a study of pain,
On how people respond to authority's reign,
It showed us how our minds can be so easily swayed,
And how pain can be caused, even when we don't want it to.
