write a poem about pain and the milgram experiment

Pain is what I feel when you touch me.

It's what I feel when you don't.

It's what I feel when you're mad at me.

It's what I feel when you're happy for me.

It's what I feel when you're not there.

It's what I feel when you're there.

It's what I feel when you're not.

It's what I feel when you are.

It's what I feel when you're not.

It's what I feel when you're not there.

It's what I feel when you're there.

It's what I feel when you're not.

It's what I feel when you are.
