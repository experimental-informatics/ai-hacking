write a short poem about milgram experiment on 2 machines
temperature =  1
textmodel= text-davinci-001
max-tokens= 1000


Two machines,
One hundred switches,
A learner,
And a teacher.

The learner is hooked up to a machine,
And the teacher has the power to shock them,
With each switch, the learner gets a shock,
The teacher decides how much.

Many people think that the machine is real,
And that they are actually shocking someone,
But in reality, it's just a machine,
A machine that measures how much someone is willing to shock someone else.
