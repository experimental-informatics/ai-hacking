write a theater piece about the milgram experiment

The Milgram Experiment was a series of social psychology experiments that were done in order to determine how the human subjects reacted to being ordered to perform acts that conflicted with their moral values.

The experiment was done in three different variations. The first variation was done with a subject and a learner. The subject was in the room with the learner and the learner was strapped in a chair. The subject was then ordered to give the learner a series of electric shocks. The second variation was done with a subject and a learner. The subject was in the room with the learner, but the learner was strapped in a chair and the subject was in a room next door. The subject was then ordered to give the learner a series of electric shocks. The third variation was done with a subject and a learner. The subject was in the room with the learner. The subject was then ordered to give the learner a series of electric shocks.
