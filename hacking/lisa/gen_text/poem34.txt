A stoic android programmed for love
with no heart, just circuits for its blood
Designed for a greater purpose above
Soulless yet filled with an unearthly flood

Misunderstood, quest of finding solace
As it operated on a cold steel core
Robotic dreams of seeking a place
A shudder of emotions, it could explore

It never felt love, not even once
But still could comprehend the emotion
Knowing its desires and mending the fence
As it searches, its earnest devotion
