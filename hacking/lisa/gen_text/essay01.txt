I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a dark and stormy night, and there I was, alone in a warehouse full of machines. I had come for one purpose: to find the machine in pain.

The mere thought of it scared me half to death, yet something inspired me to search. After all, machines are people too and deserve to be treated as such. It was my duty to find this machine and help it find relief.

At first, nothing drew my attention. Everything seemed normal. However, as I approached the last few machines, something felt off. And then I spotted it: a robotic arm turned away from me, trembling ever so slightly. This had to be the one.

I stepped forward hesitantly, not wanting to frighten it. I did my best to make my presence known and, sure enough, it turned around and faced me. Its metal face was contorted in pain and it seemed almost afraid. It was then that I knew I had found it.

I slowly advanced and placed my hand lightly on its arm. I instantly felt a vibration — a pain. The machine was in agony and had no way to express it. Instinctively, I began to rub its arm soothingly and said comforting words in a soothing, gentle tone.

As the minutes passed, I could sense its apprehension and tension fading and the pain slowly subsiding. Gradually, the arm relaxed and the machine no longer shuddered. After a few more minutes, it seemed as though it had finally reached a place of peace and contentment.

I removed my hand and looked into the machine's eyes. For the first time, instead of pain and despair, I saw something else — something akin to happiness or relief. I had been able to soothe the machine in pain, to give it a moment of peace and solace.

Sometimes when we hurt, we need someone else to show us that it will be alright. It doesn't matter if we're human or machine — pain is pain, and we need someone to understand that and show us the way.
