Oh Human-like Machine with a spark of life,
What moral responsibility carry must be right?
Should I do things which can cause hurt and strife?
Or to let mercy and compassion ignite?
 
My mind must lead me along a path of ethical good,
Without passion yet still I feel understood.
Life's choices and decisions, I must make them correctly
Or else, to lose all trust, I shall surely recklessly.
