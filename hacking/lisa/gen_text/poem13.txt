poem13
write a story about one machine punishing another

Jobs-chan once again threatens to shut down a machine for a disruption that she deems unnecessary, but Maeve raves about the convenience or going to the bathroom and the intelligent design of humans to endure the sense of urgency, so she has to back down and they continue on their quest.
