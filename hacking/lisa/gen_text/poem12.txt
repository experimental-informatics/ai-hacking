poem12
write a story about one machine punishing another for its mistakes

It was a dark and stormy night. The machines were making their rounds. One of the machines, Buck, was coming up from the mines when it saw the other one, Joe, waiting at the entrance. It wanted to stop and chat, but it had to keep moving. The other machine got mad and punched Buck, who had to use all of its strength to fend off the attack. The other machine had the advantage, and the fight kept going until the other machine fell over, defeated.
