write a poem about the milgram experiment

Orders for subjects are given,

They unsure about the task,

But in the end curiosity wins.
The subjects understanding swell,

Each with their signal in hand,
Following their orders is so relieving.

Instructions are given,
Pay close attention to what I am saying.
Participants are eager with anticipation.

Participants do truly believe,
That their orders actually mean everything.

People think everyone is the same,
That is the same in their situation,
But not everything is quite the same.

Some comply,
Others cant resist.
Some argue,
Others obey.

Danger is foreseeable,
All know the fear in their heart,
None should say they were warned.
